Give feedback, recommendations and bug reports If you find any issues, have ideas or recommendations or want to report a bug, please open an issue at the Cantara Github repository. I work completely via Github on the project, so that would be the best way to go. If you have no Github account and don’t want to create one, ask a friend to do it for you.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><lastBuildDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 15:11:10 +0200</lastBuildDate><atom:link href="https://www.cantara.app/contribute/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Translate</title><link>https://www.cantara.app/contribute/translate/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 15:11:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.cantara.app/contribute/translate/index.html</guid><description>Cantara can be easily translated to an other language. While doing so, you will help to spread the use of the software all over the world, so that also people who don’t speak English have access to Cantara.
How it works Cantara uses language files (*.mo-files) which contain the translated language strings in a binary language. This files can be created by using an editor like Poedit using the cantara.pot file as a template.</description></item><item><title>Contributors</title><link>https://www.cantara.app/contribute/contributors/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 15:11:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.cantara.app/contribute/contributors/index.html</guid><description>Cantara would not have been possible without the help of the following contributors (GitHub users in alphabetical order):

While doing so, you will help to spread the use of the software all over the world, so that also people who don’t speak English have access to Cantara.
How it works Cantara uses language files (*.mo-files) which contain the translated language strings in a binary language. This files can be created by using an editor like Poedit using the cantara.pot file as a template.</description></item><item><title>Contributors</title><link>https://www.cantara.app/contribute/contributors/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 15:11:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.cantara.app/contribute/contributors/index.html</guid><description>Cantara would not have been possible without the help of the following contributors (GitHub users in alphabetical order):

When conducting our events, we liked to sing a few songs at the beginning. However the problem occurred that the available song books where not enough and the content was sometimes not matching with the songs which were wished. At that time I was looking for an available song presentation program and became disappointed quickly. Most of the existing programs were either commercial, very complicated or simply an “overkill” for the basically quite simple purpose: People should be able to (spontaneously) choosing songs, the program should then display them.</description></item><item><title>Install Cantara</title><link>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/install-cantara/index.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 15:37:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/install-cantara/index.html</guid><description>This page describes how you can install Cantara on your local operating system.

You will then see the welcome assistent which helps you to go through the configuration of Cantara. Here you should choose a song repository directory where you all the song lyrics files are stored. If you have none yet, you can create an empty new folder and select it as your song repository. The assistent will suggest you to add “Amazing Grace” as an example song which you can use to understand how the program works.</description></item><item><title>Manage Songs</title><link>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/where-to-get-the-songs/index.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 15:37:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/where-to-get-the-songs/index.html</guid><description>When using Cantara, you will need to collect, edit and distribute songs which can be used for presenting or exporting. If you start Cantara for the first time, you will notice that–depending on what you have chosen in the welcome assistent–you might only find one song available: “Amazing Grace”. From that point on, you can start to get and add songs.
The folder which you choose two be your song repository will contain all the songs which you use in Cantara. That means that in order to add a new song, it is enough to just add a new file in that folder. Likewise you might proceed for editing or deleting songs. If you want to share all songs with someone else, just copy the files of your dictionary or share the folder itself. It has been also developed as a common pratice to create a Git repository in your repository folder which than can be shared via Github, Gitlab or other providers.</description></item><item><title>Song Meta Data</title><link>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/meta-data/index.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 15:37:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/meta-data/index.html</guid><description>Cantara allows you to fetch and display meta data from the songs.

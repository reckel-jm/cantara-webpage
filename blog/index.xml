Originally only designed for my personal purpose (having a simple song presentation program for church groups) it is now a widely used Open Source project. According to the snap store statistics (which is the only reliable one I have at the moment), Cantara is currently used by more then 120 individuals from 39 countries around the world. In addition to that, there are AUR, Flatpak and Windows users from which I don’t have any statistical data. Cantara has been translated into Chinese, Italien, Spanish and German by the community and whenever when I get some feedback, I am really happy to see how this little program can be a tool to serve the church for the honor of God. With that being said, I would like to introduce some ideas and plans which I have for the future of the program and I am interested in your thoughts and suggestions as well:</description></item></channel></rss>

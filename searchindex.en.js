    "content": "Background Story When I was at my high school time, I became part in the leadership of a Christian youth group. When conducting our events, we liked to sing a few songs at the beginning. However the problem occurred that the available song books where not enough and the content was sometimes not matching with the songs which were wished. At that time I was looking for an available song presentation program and became disappointed quickly. Most of the existing programs were either commercial, very complicated or simply an ‚Äúoverkill‚Äù for the basically quite simple purpose: People should be able to (spontaneously) choosing songs, the program should then display them.\nAt that time, I decided to start the development of Cantara. The name is coming from the Latin ‚Äúcantare‚Äù (to sing) but more artificial then real. An other reason for choosing the name was that at the same time, I was becoming an organ player in church ‚Äìand the German name for that position is ‚ÄúKantor‚Äù which sounds quite similar.\nLater I have been able to lead the best student group in the world üòÉ and while doing so, the program slowly was growing and updated with new futures like multi-screen-support and the opportunity to export song texts directly to the clipboard so that it can be used in small groups without beamer projection possibility. Cantara‚Äôs development will continue and I hope that it will be a small tool to praise and worship our great heavenly father!\nThe Approach graph LR; A[Input File] --\u003e|Collecting Songs| B(Song List) B --\u003e C(Song Selection) C --\u003e D{Generate Presentation Data} D --\u003e E[Run Presentation Directly] D --\u003e F[Export Lyrics in Markup Format] D --\u003e G[Export Presentation as PPTX] D --\u003e H[Export Presentation as Pictures] Cantara takes the songs from one particular folder on the file system which is called the song repository (or briefly song repo). Every song is a simple text file which can be edited with a text editor of your choice. Cantara will recognize the song title from the name of the file (without the extension). So, for example. If you have a file like:\nAmazing Grace.song Cantara will recognize it as ‚ÄúAmazing Grace‚Äù written in the song format (for formats see the next section).\nTip The song repository dictionary can be shared and synced easily via cloud services like NextCloud or Git. In that way you can distribute songs within your group or organization.\nTip Since version 2.4.0, Cantara offers a built-in editor which you can use to edit the songs and convert CCLI songs to the Cantara song format. Notice that the songs remain single text files and therefore can still be edited with any text editor.\nWarning The developers of Cantara are not responsible for copyright issues which come along with the public use and distributions of song lyrics. Make sure that you obtain the rights for using the song lyrics! In Germany, religious gatherings with free admission enjoy higher copyright freedom than commercial events. However, please make sure with your organization that no legal problems arise.\nThe windows/modes of Cantara Cantara consists of different windows which allow you to use the program.\nWindows Song Selection Window Presentation Window Presentation Controller Settings Editor This windows will be displayed after you start Cantara. It allows you to see the songs which are available and select those which you would like to use in the presentation or to export. The presentation window will show and control the loaded presentation (in single screen mode). It can be set to full screen and moved to an other screen. If you close the presentation window, the presentation will end and you will return to the song selection window. In multi screen mode, the presentation controller allows you to control the presentation in detail which is shown at the presentation window. You can see all slides, jump to a slide directly or quit the presentation. Normally, you would place the presentation controller on the first screen (the default screen) and the presentation window at the second screen (which is displayed at the beamer, external monitor, etc.). Tip The presentation controller uses the song selection window.\nThe settings window allows you to adjust the presentation style and change the path of the song repository. You can open the settings in the song selection window. The editor allows to add, modify, convert and remove songs in your song repository. You can open the editor via Edit -\u003e Song Lyrics... in the song selection window.",

    "content": "This page describes how you can install Cantara on your local operating system.\nWindows Installation on Windows is very easy and done in just one minute. You can either use the Windows package manager Winget or download and run the installer manually.\nUsing winget (Windows 10 and Windows 11) If you are running one of the modern versions of Windows (Windows 10 1709 or later), you can use Winget to install Cantara safely and keep it up to date. Simply open a Windows Powershell and run the following command:\nwinget install cantara Winget will download the installer, ask you once for confirmation and afterwards runs the installer silently. If a new version gets published, you can update via winget upgrade --all or winget upgrade cantara.\nIf you would like to remove Cantara from your system, you can run winget uninstall cantara.\nRunning the installer If you don‚Äôt like to use winget, you can also download and run the installer manually which will lead you through the process of installation.\nSimply download and run the installer, go through the questions and install Cantara. After the installation, you will find the program in your start menu. In addition, if you have chosen the option during the setup process, you will also have a shortcut on your desktop.\nInfo When starting the installer, Windows might warn you that the source is unknown and the executable unsigned. In this case, you can choose ‚ÄúProceed‚Äù to continue. This is due to the fact that I don‚Äôt own a certificate which I could use for certification of the executable. However as the software has been published to Winget, you can safely install it from there and without seeing this notification.\nLinux Cantara was developed by a Linux fan and enthusiast. So, it is my pleasure to make sure that Cantara is working well on every Linux distribution.\nInfo Cantara can use the Qt6, QT5 and GTK2 librarys for the graphical user interface. Depending on the distribution channel, Cantara is precompiled with Qt6 or Qt5-bindings. If you prefer GTK2, please compile cantara by yourself.\nArch Linux and Arch based distributions (Manjaro, Garuda, etc.) The Arch User Repository (AUR) The Arch User Repository (AUR) contains package built information which allows you to build software packages automatically and install them on your local file system. This is the prefered way for installation of software outside of the official repositories. There are two Cantara package builds in the AUR: Use cantara-bin for a pre-compiled version of Cantara and cantara if you would like the system to compile the package. Note that for the installation process of the second option, the compilers and libraries of Pascal and Lazarus have to get downloaded and installed which might require several hundred megabytes of disk space. You can delete these tools after the compilation process has been completed.\nThere are many ways how to install a package from the AUR. Most people might use a helper like yay. Just install one of the packages:\nyay cantara-bin # fast and compact installation of pre-compiled binary yay cantara # downloads source code and compile by yourself Note A big advantage of using a helper like yay is that it will also keep the packages up-to-date! Whenever a new version of Cantara gets released, you should be able to update it via sudo yay -Syu\nOnce installed, Cantara can be uninstalled via pacman: sudo pacman -R cantara.\nPre-Built Pacman Installation Package If you don‚Äôt like to use the AUR, you can also use the pre-built Pacman package from the Github repository. For downloading and installing the package, simply enter the following commands in the command line:\nwget https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara/releases/download/v2.6.0/cantara-2.6.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst sudo pacman -U cantara-2.6.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst Cantara is now installed and ready for use. If you later would like to uninstall it, you can use Pacman as well:\nsudo pacman -R cantara Ubuntu/Debian based Linux distributions Please use Snap or Flatpak as described in the concerning sections.\nSnap Cantara is available at the Snap Store! The snap package now only takes 4.5 MB and is therefore a good distribution-independent way to install Cantara. You can follow the instructions on the Cantara store page to find out how to install it on your local system or - if snapd is already running - install it via the command line.\nsudo snap install cantara Info The way how a Snap application is running is different from a normal package. Therefore there might be some different behavior e.g. a different look of the program. In any case, feel free to report every unexpected behavior so that I can try to fix it.\nSnap will create a starter in the start menu. If you like to run Cantara via the command line, the command is snap run cantara.\nTip You can also install different versions of Cantara at the same time and even install Cantara as a classical package and a snap together. Check the Snap Documentation for further details.\nFlatpak/Flathub Cantara has been packaged as a Flatpak as well and can be installed and updated from flathub.org. This requires an installed flatpak on your operation system. Some distribution like Fedora have this already out of the box, in other distributions like Arch Linux, you need to install it manually.\nInstalling a flatpak from flathub can be done via a graphical software management tool, for example Gnome Software or KDE Discover, or via the command line:\nflatpak install app.cantara.Cantara Depending on the flats you have already installed, flatpak might download several houndreds of megabytes for the required KDE/Qt-runtimes. That being said, although the actual Cantara flat is less then 4 MB installing Cantara via flatpak is for sure not the most disk space friendly way.\nGeneric Run of Binaries Warning Installing Cantara without using your native package manager or a containerized format (Snap/Flatpak) is strongly discouraged and not recommended. Use this only for locally running Cantara without installation.\nAs an other distribution-independant way of using Cantara, you can manually download and run the binary. Please be aware that Cantara needs the libqt5pas library which is normally resolved by the package dependancy management of your distribution‚Äôs package manager. However, if you don‚Äôt use the package manager for installation, you need to install libqt5pas manually. Afterwards, download the Zip-File from the Github Repository, extract it, make the binary executable and run cantara:\nwget https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara/releases/download/v2.6.0/cantara-2.6.0-linux-x86_64_bin.tar.gz tar -zxvf cantara-2.6.0-linux-x86_64_bin.tar.gz cd cantara-2.6.0-linux-x86_64_bin chmod +x cantara ./cantara Generic Compilation Install lazarus and lazbuild from your local repository. If you prefer QT5, you could also install lazarus-qt instead of lazarus if the distribution provides a certain package. After you have done that, the compilation is quite easy: Download the source code, extract it and run lazbuild with the appropriate options.\nwget https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara/archive/refs/tags/v2.6.0.tar.gz tar -zxvf v2.6.0.tar.gz cd v2.6.0 make If you prefer GTK2, change the option to --ws=gtk2 in the makefile. If done with no errors, you will find the executable binary cantara in the same folder.\nMac OS Cantara is working on Mac OS X. However, it has not been officially certified which means that you can not install it in a normal way yet. Please follow these steps to use Cantara:\nDownload the Cantara Mac OS X binary from Github. Open the zip-Archive in Finder so that it will exttract the content to a folder. Open a terminal and navigate to the Folder, for example with cd Downloads/cantara-2.6.0-macosx if you are using the default Download folder. When you are in the extracted folder, make the binary file executable with chmod +x src/cantara.app/Contents/cantara Run the binary with ./src/cantara.app/Contents/cantara. Cantara should start now. You can attach it to the dock so that you can open it easily again.",

    "content": "First Steps After the installation, simply open Cantara with your start menu or the cantara command. You will then see the welcome assistent which helps you to go through the configuration of Cantara. Here you should choose a song repository directory where you all the song lyrics files are stored. If you have none yet, you can create an empty new folder and select it as your song repository. The assistent will suggest you to add ‚ÄúAmazing Grace‚Äù as an example song which you can use to understand how the program works.\nAfter you have finished the welcome assistent, you should also adjust the font settings, the text color or the background color according to your wishes. You can do that in the Settings (Edit -\u003e Settings). The option Spoiler next Slide will show the lyrics of the next song part in smaller font size under the current part.\nBeside that, you can configure how the Meta Data of songs should be displayed. See more details in the section Meta Data.\nThe Song Selection Window If the configuration has been done successfully, you will come to the song selection window where you can choose the songs which you would like to sing. The search field may help you to find the one you like. Simply double-click or press enter after the selection of the song in the left list, and the song will go to the right list where you can adjust the order or remove the selected songs. After you are done, press the Presentation button to start the presentation. You can also press CTRL+P instead.\nTip Cantara will automatically detect at start whether you have connected a second monitor (like a second screen or a beamer) to your PC. If so, it will select the two-windows-mode automatically. You can also adjust this as you want.\nDuring the Presentation Mode During the presentation mode, you can control the presentation slides via several ways:\nUsing the arrow keys: You can use the arrow keys of your keyboard to go forward or backwardF Pressing F5/F11: this will toggle fullscreen Using the Enter or Space key: You can use Enter or Space for moving a slide forward Pressing ESC: will end the presentation Mouse Click: Will move a slide forward Clicking at a song at the right selection list in the song selection window (multi screen-mode only): You can directly jump to a certain song Tip If you are running other programs like Libreoffice Impress or MS PowerPoint in presentation mode at the same time, you can easily switch between the presenters with Alt+Tab. When the presentation mode in Cantara gets started, it will cover the second screen and be in foreground. To move Cantara to the background, press Alt+Tab to navigate to the program you want to show up.\nAdjust the Presentation After you have seen the default presentation style, you might want to adjust it according to your wishes and needs. For this, you can open the settings dialog (Edit -\u003e Settings). There you can set up the following:\nSong Repo Path: The path of the song repository. Use the button with the three points (..) in order to select a file chooser dialog. Empty Slides between songs: This creates an additional empty slide in the presentation between two different songs. Spoil next slides: Displays the content or parts of of the next slide below the text if the song has an additional slide and the space of the slide is sufficient. Alignment: Adjust the horizontal and vertical alignment of the text in the presentation slides. Press Details to set up the border size. Automatic word wrap: Brakes the slides into if one stanza (song part) has reached the specified limit of lines (recommended especially if you have songs with long stanzas). Change Font Settings‚Ä¶/Background Color‚Ä¶/Text Color‚Ä¶: Opens dialogs for specifing the design of the presentation. Background Image: Opens a file chooser dialog where you can select a background image for your presentations. If available, the folder with some default background pictures will be opened at first. Change Image Transparancy: Adjusts the image transparency towards the background color. That means if the background color is (for example) set to black, a higher value will make the picture darker. If the background would be white, a higher value will make the picture brighter. Show Meta Data: Certain Meta data can be shown at a special title slide (if choosen), at the first slide or at the last slide. Enter the syntax in the big edit field at the bottom and see Meta Data for detalis. Preview image: Click at the preview to go one slide forward. If the presentation has reached its end, it will go back to the beginning. Export Presentation Cantara offers several ways for exporting presentations so that they can be reused in an other program or for an other purpose. All the export options are available in the export menu of the main window. Generally, there are two types of exports:\nExport the presentation slides: This will export the presentation slides exactly as they are displayed inside Cantara. At the moment there are two export options for this type: Power Point Presentation (.pptx-file): This will export the slide presentation as a pptx file so that it can be used in a presentation program (Microsoft Powerpoint, Libreoffice Impress, Softmaker Presentation etc.). For the generation of the slides, the JavaScript library PptxGenJs (MIT license) will be used inside the local web browser as a renderer. Pictures/Images: This will export a JPEG file for every slide and save it into a folder of choice. Export the Lyrics as Markup: It will export the lyrics of the songs in their right order in a specified markup format but without any presentation settings (slide breaks, background picture, colors, etc.). This can be used (but is not limited) for: Exporting the songs as a WhatsApp/Telegram message so that it can be shared a long groups/channels for the congregation/people to sing along Exporting the songs as a HTML webpage so they can be published on a webpage Exporting just the titles of the song so they can be reported to CCLI. The structure of the markup can be specified through a LaTeX style markup language. Go to Export -\u003e Markup Text To open the Markup Export window.\nThe template language supports the following commands/environments. All of them are optional:\n\\header { ... }: The header part of the document which will be shown at the top of the document. No song specific content can be displayed here as this part is outside of the song loop. \\footer { ... }: The footer part of the document which will be shown at the bottom of the document. No song specific content can be displayed here as this part is outside of the song loop. \\newline: Inserts a system default line break \\betweensongs { ... }: Defines what should be displayed between two songs (but not before the first song and after the last song). The default value is set to two line breaks (a new paragraph: \\betweensongs { \\newline \\newline }) \\lineending: Specifies the line ending inside the song loop (default value is \\newline) \\songloop { ... } The content which will be displayed for each song (repeated for each song). Inside this environment, song tags (see Meta Data) can be accessed via \\tagname ‚Äì for example \\title for the title tag and \\author for the author tag. The lyrics itself a loaded via the \\lyrics command. Save and Load Song Selections You can save and load song selections into Cantara to share it within the organization or for preparing an event. While doing so, you have two options:\nThe songtex-format contains the song names and the song file with its content. That means, if you export the songselection to a songtex-file, the receiver don‚Äôt need to have the songs in his song repository. While importing the songtex-file, Cantara checks whether the file already exists in the repository, and, if not, adds it. The legacy export/import function imports only the titles, that means, the receiver needs to have the songs in his song repository.",

    "content": "When using Cantara, you will need to collect, edit and distribute songs which can be used for presenting or exporting. If you start Cantara for the first time, you will notice that‚Äìdepending on what you have chosen in the welcome assistent‚Äìyou might only find one song available: ‚ÄúAmazing Grace‚Äù. From that point on, you can start to get and add songs.\nThe folder which you choose two be your song repository will contain all the songs which you use in Cantara. That means that in order to add a new song, it is enough to just add a new file in that folder. Likewise you might proceed for editing or deleting songs. If you want to share all songs with someone else, just copy the files of your dictionary or share the folder itself. It has been also developed as a common pratice to create a Git repository in your repository folder which than can be shared via Github, Gitlab or other providers.\nUnderstanding the way how songs are saved Cantara supports two different song formats. One has the file ending .song and is very simply designed. It just contains the lyrics in the order as they should be presented along with some tags which describe the meta data of the songs. The other format is used by CCLI Songselect and has the file endings .txt or .ccli. CCLI is a commercial database where you can download a lot of Christian songs for the use in churches or Christian groups.\nTip A lot of Christian church denominations and groups in Germany (including FeG, SMD as far as I know) provide member access to CCLI Songselect. You can find out whether you organization has already booked a subscription for you.\nCantara will automatically detect the correct song format and interpretate it in the way as stated below.\nThe song file format The song file format is a file which ends with .song. The lyrics there have to be printed in the same order as they should be shown including repetitions. Different slides are seperated with a double linebreak (an empty line). For example, if you would like to add the song ‚Äú‚ÄòTis so sweet to trust in Jesus‚Äù, add a new file 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus.song with the following content:\nExpand the file content 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus Just to take Him at His word Just to rest upon His promise Just to know thus saith the Lord Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more O how sweet to trust in Jesus Just to trust His cleansing blood Just in simple faith to plunge me 'Neath the healing cleansing flood Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more Yes 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus Just from sin and self to cease Just from Jesus simply taking Life and rest and joy and peace Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee Precious Jesus Savior Friend And I know that Thou art with me Wilt be with me to the end Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more The song consists of four stanzas with the chorus repeated after each one. Now, let‚Äôs say that we would like to have a slightly different version of the song where we sing two stanzas together. A good convention fot this would be to copy the existing file 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus.song to 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus [two stanzas together].song and adjust the content:\nExpand the file content 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus Just to take Him at His word Just to rest upon His promise Just to know thus saith the Lord O how sweet to trust in Jesus Just to trust His cleansing blood Just in simple faith to plunge me 'Neath the healing cleansing flood Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more Yes 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus Just from sin and self to cease Just from Jesus simply taking Life and rest and joy and peace I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee Precious Jesus Savior Friend And I know that Thou art with me Wilt be with me to the end Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more Cantara will detect both song files and list them next to each other. While this approach seems to be a little bit complecated at the beginning, the practical usage has shown that it is much easier then using more complex file formats. You can always use your local text editor to adjust the lyrics as you like them to be. There will be no danger of missinterpretation or wrong order.\nCCLI Songselect The CCLI songselect format will be used if you download a song from CCLI songselect. In opposite to the song format, the CCLI songselect lyrics format provides no clear information about the correct order of the different parts in a song (stanzas/choruses etc.). So, Cantara has to guess the order with an implemented algorithm. For most of the songs, Cantara will put the lyrics into the correct order. However, some of the CCLI song files lack consistency. In this case, you can convert the CCLI file to a song file and manually edit it according to your needs.\nNote Due to the lack of consitency, it is not recommended to edit a CCLI songselect file directly. Cantara will ask you to convert it to a song file first.\nHere is some information about the parts which Cantara does understand:\n‚ÄúVers/Strophe‚Äù: a stanza which will be sung only once at the placed position ‚ÄúChorus‚Äù: if available, the chorus will be sung at the placed position and afterwards repeated after every stanza or bridge. If an other chorus will come, it will replace the first one. ‚ÄúBridge‚Äù: Will be treated like a stanza. A chorus will (most likely) follow if there has been one before. ‚ÄúPreChorus‚Äù: Will be sung before chorus (here the format is quite inconsistent!) ‚ÄúSchluss‚Äù: A closing part of the song. No chorus will follow. Note The editor is capable of converting CCLI files to the song format. Just open a CCLi file in the editor and confirm that you would like to perform the conversion.\nDownload songs from CCLI Songselect As stated above, you can directly import songs from CCLI Songselect. Go to their webpage, login with your account and search for the song which you want to download. Press the speech bubble symbol right next to it (see picture below). After the text is shown, click at the third blue button from the left with the download symbol. Save the .txt-file directly into the Cantara song repository directory. Cantara should recognize the song and use the lyrics in the correct order.\nWarning As stated before, it is your responsability to comply with the legal requirements of CCLI and the song copyright owners when using their services!\nAdditional Song Lyrics Sources Hymnary.org: A very large hymn collection (mostly English) Evangeliums.net: A German collection of Christian songs, some can not be accessed directly due to copyright restrictions The Cantara SongRepo at Github: Contains Public Domain Songs for free and direct use Edit and convert songs with the built-in editor Cantara offers a built-in editor which provides an easy way to create songs, edit them or remove them. In addition, you can convert a CCLI song to the song format so that it might be adapted to your needs.",

    "content": "When I started Cantara six years ago (three years before I created this Github repository), I didn‚Äôt except that I would continue the project for such a long time. Originally only designed for my personal purpose (having a simple song presentation program for church groups) it is now a widely used Open Source project. According to the snap store statistics (which is the only reliable one I have at the moment), Cantara is currently used by more then 120 individuals from 39 countries around the world. In addition to that, there are AUR, Flatpak and Windows users from which I don‚Äôt have any statistical data. Cantara has been translated into Chinese, Italien, Spanish and German by the community and whenever when I get some feedback, I am really happy to see how this little program can be a tool to serve the church for the honor of God. With that being said, I would like to introduce some ideas and plans which I have for the future of the program and I am interested in your thoughts and suggestions as well:\nCantara as a presentation program and presentation provider A lot of churches have a complex presentation workflow for their church services/events which includes song presentations, presentations for the sermon (provided by the preacher), videos, Bible readings, announcements, etc. Although there are all-in-one-solutions who are designed for addressing all of this purposes, they are often lacking in functionality compared to the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù ones. For example, a lot of sermons will be designed in PowerPoint, Libre Office Impress, LaTeX beamer or any other presentation software. It is unlikely that Cantara‚Äìeven if we would try‚Äìcould ever get the same functionality as these programs. However, Cantara could be a provider to such workflows if it allows to export the song presentations in these formats. Therefore I am planning to add an export functionality which allows to generate presentations which can be imported into other programs for getting a unified workflow experience. At the moment, my idea is as following:\nPowerPoint presentations can be easily created via the PptxGenJS-library which is published under the MIT license. We could use the systems web browser to run the JavaScript and in that way keep Cantara leightweight. Cantara would need to export the presentations into some JavaScript code which can be used by the web browser + PptxGenJS to create a pptx. In addition to that, I would like to provide export options into revealJs and LaTeX Beamer slides which are also widely used and Open Source which is definitely an important reason to support these. I would love to use the Libre Office format (odp). However I don‚Äôt know any library/framework which could be used to generate such files. If anyone has some hints for me, feel free to share. This is all of course in addition to the presentation functionality and not as a replacement. The users will have the choice whether they would like to use Cantara as a song presentation tool or whether they would like to use it to generate the presentations which an be embedded into their presentation program of choice.\nGenerate Sheets and Chords for the Musicians An other long time desired feature would be to extend the musical functionality of Cantara so that the software could also generate sheets PDFs for the musicians. For that, I would prefer a combination of LuaLaTeX, Lilypond and lyluatex which allows the generation of nice song books. The idea is that in addition to the song lyrics, song sheets (either an ly-file or a pdf file) can be managed as well. If a song presentation is created, Cantara would be also able to generate the sheets and put them into one PDF file so that the musicians don‚Äôt need to look for the sheets by themselves.\nAn alternative approach would be a JavaScript framework such as OpensheetmusicDisplay. This would require the source files to be in MusicXML instead of Liilypond and would not allow complete PDFs to be imported.\nMigrating to Flutter? Pascal is an amazing programing language for development and Lazarus is very good for platform independent programing. However, with the time going forward there are other widely supported alternatives as well. One of them is Flutter which has been developed by Google. It would allow to create one application for all (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android, iOS). Whether it fits or not, could be evaluated in the future, so that maybe a long term migration to Flutter could be an option (but does not have to).\nTime Roadmap Due to private circumstances, development will be continued after April 2023. Till that time, I have to finish my master thesis and collect more ideas and plans :-)\nAny ideas, comments or thoughts? Continue the discussion on Github",
